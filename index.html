          <h2>Cerulean Singe</h2>
          <p>
            My current project in development since 2022. A first-person souls-like focusing on snappy and satisfying combat. I spend my freetime chipping away at it, and hoping to get a demo out by late 2024.

          <h2>K.R.O.B.I.F.</h2>
          <p>
            A project that started as just a small game jam game, which I continued to work on for a few months after. The game only consists of a sandbox level to play around with the mechanics I implemented.

          <h2>Goober Eats</h2>
          <p>
          A student project I created in my first year of college to learn the Construct 3 game engine. The goal of the game is to deliver the food to the customer by trespassing on a construction site, all while avoiding obstacles.

          <h2>Hell's Deli</h2>
          <p>
            One of my most polished games, Hell's deli is another game jam project created alongside a teammate who handled most of the art. The game is about making sandwiches in hell, and your goal is to get a higher score than the demon chef competing against you.

          <h2>Off The Frozen Rock</h2>
          <p>
            This was the first completed game I created back in 2021. It is a VR game in which the player goes around a small floating island collecting rocks to power a cannon to launch themselves off the island, all while keeping track of their body temperature to stay alive.
